            <h2>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular <br>than the Taj Mahal? </h2><br>
        </div>
        <div class="para2">
            <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.<br> At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent<br> than building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing<br> its magnificence up close.<br>
                After all, this is art. Built in Agra, India between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s<br>the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. 
                 So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj<br> Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from<br> Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.<br>
                 Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), <br>and so much more…</p>
            <h2>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h2>     
            <p class="paragra1">That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br>
                Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.<br>
                To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.<br>
                Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from<span class="link2"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456"> 8-day Golden Triangle tours</a></span> (now with solo-only<br> departures!) to <span class="link3"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/india-real-food-adventure-151125"> 15-day trips dedicated to food,</a></span> to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India<br>and Nepal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="para3">
            <h2>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have<br> minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.<br><br>
            You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Passport</li>
            <li>Money</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Medicine</li>
            <li>Camera</li>
            <li>Phone</li>
         </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="para4">
            <h2>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, <br>you will need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.<br>

                It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear<br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br>
                
                If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid<br> the worst of the heat.

            <h2>Other things you need to know</h2>
            <p>
                No food is allowed inside.<br>

Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.<br>

Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. 
<br>Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and <br>small video cameras) are not allowed.<br>

Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your <br>wits about you and you won’t need to worry!

            <h2>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if<br> possible).</p>
            <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg" >
            <p>If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an <br>amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. 
                (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to <br>take you there and back cheaply.)<br>
             And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly<br> (or more!) remain in awe of it. 
                Sana Jinah, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has<br> some tips on how to do this:</p>

            <h2>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit<br> on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.
            </p>

            <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth<br> seeking out.

                Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, Pravin<br> Tamang. His photography is amazing – <span class="link3"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/cities-india-street-photography/" >(check it out!)</a></span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
            <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main<br> platform</li>
            <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
            <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
            <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then<br> explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
        <h3>What to do in Agra</h3>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort<br> is also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century<br> Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.

            <br>Despite being located on the<span class="link4"> <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456" >Golden Triangle </a></span> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than<br> in many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you <br>likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.
            
            <br>One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by <br>(sometimes) taking travelers to Sheroes Hangout. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe <br>run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their<br> stories. 
            It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p>

        <div class="para9">
            <h3>Where to go outside of Agra</h3>
            <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these,<br> Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.<br><br>
             Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br>and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit <br>it on this 15-day trip from Delhi to Kathmandu (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p>
        <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg">
        <h4>Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</h4>
        <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the<span class="link6"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/top-colourful-cities/">  ‘Pink City’, </a></span> capital of Rajasthan is full of <br>chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br>bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.<br>

            Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home<br> to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy<br> nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this 15-day trip all around<br> Rajasthan.</p>

                <h2>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h2>
                <p>As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough<br> clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.<br>
          Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white<br> surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – <br>applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried<br> out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects<br> carried out on the historic site.</p>
